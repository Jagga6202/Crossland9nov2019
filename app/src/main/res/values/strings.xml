    <string name="oet1">The OET (Occupational English Test) assesses the English language communication skills of healthcare
        professionals who wish to practice in an English-speaking environment. The exam is accepted across the majority of
        regulators, hospitals and universities in the UK, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Dubai, Singapore, and Namibia.
        The Occupational English Test (also known as OET) was developed to test healthcare professionalsâ€™ English communication abilities.
        OET tests English language ability in four areas: Listening, Reading, Writing and Speaking. Test takers will need to demonstrate their ability
        to understand and answer questions about general healthcare consultations and presentations, in addition to texts in a general healthcare setting.
        </string>
    <string name="oet2">OET was designed in the late 1980s by Professor Tim McNamara, in the University of Melbourne,
        under the guidance of the Australian National Office for Overseas Skills Recognition (NOOSR), which administered the test at that time.
        Since March 2013 the test has been owned by Cambridge Boxhill Language Assessment Trust (CBLA),
        a venture between Cambridge English Language Assessment and Box Hill Institute.</string>
    <string name="oet3">How to apply for OET ?
You can apply to take OET by visiting www.occupationalenglishtest.org/apply-oet/ .
        When you register to take OET, you might only be able to select from the next
        two available test dates, so you should aim to begin revising for the test before applying.
        To apply online, you will need to refer to an identification document and upload a colour passport photograph of yourself.
